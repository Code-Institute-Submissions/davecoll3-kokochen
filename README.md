# UX and UI

## Research

Reasearch for the creation of this site was carried out by searching online for other freelance illustrators who have a portfolio website; links to the main sites used are linked below. These sites were examanied with the end goal of extracting the key elements required for an illustrators portfolio site. From this examination, I established that information about the illustrator, examples of their work, links to their social media pages and a means of contacting them were common across all of these sites. The importance of using the illustrators images through the sites was also evident, maximising the exposure of their origional works to the user.

* Illustrator #2: [Dave Bain](https://davebain.com/about)
* Illustrator #3: [Carys Tait](https://www.carys-ink.com/about)
* Illustrator #4: [Amy Jackson](https://www.ajillustration.co.uk/bio)
* Illustrator #5: [Jessica Smith](https://www.jessicasmithillustration.co.uk/)
* Illustrator #6: [Gemma Hastilow](https://gemmahastilow.co.uk/)

&nbsp;

## Owner Goals

  * Showcase illustrations and examples of previous work.
  * To generate interest in their work.
  * To receive new commissions.

&nbsp;

## User Stories

### First Time Visitor

  * As a first time user, I want to understand the main purpose of the site.
  * As a first time user, I want relevant content that informs about the owner and their work.
  * As a first time user, I want an easy means of contacting the site owner.

### Returning Visitor

  * As a returning user, I want to be easily able to locate and review images or information on the site.
  * As a returning user, I want to be able to quickly contact the site owner.
  * As a returning user, I want to be able to quickly access the site owner's social media links.

&nbsp;

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

  * Familar and intuitive design that negates any learning curve.
  * A reactive site that is user friendly and well presented on all types of device and screen sizes.
  * An easy and logical means of navigation throughout the site on all devices.
  * Adequate levels of color contrast across the site that presents content in an accessable and easy to read manner.
  * An appealing presentation of the owner's origional illustrations.
  * Links to the owner's social media sites and other material of interest.

### Expectations

  * Feedback when intereacting with page links allowing me to easily know where I am on the site and where I can go to.
  * Feedback on the contact form to inform me when it has been completed and submitted correctly.
  * When clicking on social media links, they should open in a seperate tab or window.

&nbsp;

## Design

### Color Scheme

* Various shades of grey (#777, #708090, #696969, #d3d3d3, #3f3f3f) were used across the site (nav bar, footer, scoll to top button) alongside black and white for the textual content. These somber colours were purposfully chosen to give the site a clean modern look while allowing the vibrant colours of the various illustrations to pop on the screen. The color contrast accessibility validator [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/) was used to verify that the colour contrast across the site adheared to the WCAG 2.1 Guidelines. 

### Fonts

* The Google font of Barlow was chosen as it closely resembles font use on other promotional work by the site owner. Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contract font which lends fits in with the clean modern look of the site.
  
### Imagery

* All images used across the site, including background images, are origional creations of the site owner. The background images were used on the home page (callout banner) and contact me page (form) to provive a visually appealing backdrop to these pages, helping to highlight content contained within.

### Structure

* The information architecture type used for this site is the hierarchical tree structure. This common structure allows for simple navigation thoughout the site and allows for easy expansion of the site in the future. The use of the burger navagition icon, along with a floating return to top button, help to overcome the common issues with this structure on mobile devices.

  ![Contact Me](/readme-files/images/contact-me.png)

* Back to Top Button

    ![Back to Top Button](/readme-files/images/back-to-top-btn.png)

## Features to be Implemented in Future

  * Adding an isotope filter to the gallery page once I have a better understanding of JavaScript. This will allow users to more easily view illustrations that share a common theme or style.
  * Additionally, I would like to use JavaScript to better control the positioning of the back to top button; having it fade in as you scroll down the page.
  * An extra shop page that allows users to purchase items such as prints, cards and badges directly from the owner.

&nbsp;

# Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Validator Testing 

    - HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs

    You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

[//]: # (Deployment section for step-by-step forking and cloning instructions)

&nbsp;

# Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
