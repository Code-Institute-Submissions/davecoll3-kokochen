# UX and UI

## Research

Reasearch for the creation of this site was carried out by searching online for other freelance illustrators who have a portfolio website; links to the main sites used are linked below. These sites were examanied with the end goal of extracting the key elements required for an illustrators portfolio site. From this examination, I established that information about the illustrator, examples of their work, links to their social media pages and a means of contacting them were common across all of these sites. The importance of using the illustrators images through the sites was also evident, maximising the exposure of their origional works to the user.

    For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

    In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

* ## Features to be Implemented in Future

    - Adding an isotope filter to the gallery page once I have a better understanding of JavaScript. This will allow users to more easily view illustrations that share a common theme or style.
    - An extra shop page that allows users to purchase items such as prints, cards and badges directly from the owner.

# Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

&nbsp;

* ## Unfixed Bugs

    You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

[//]: # (Deployment section for step-by-step forking and cloning instructions)

&nbsp;

# Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
