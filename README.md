# Kokochen

Marien Wong Kwok Chuen is a freelance illustrator living in Metz, France. This portfolio site aims to showcase Marine's illustrations and examples of her work. The site will be targeted towards individuals and organisations who have a need for a talented freelance illustrator. It will clearly demonstrate a variety of original illustrations produced to date along with examples of illustrations used in previously commissioned work. The site will also be a useful means to contact Marine in order to commission new work.

The primary technologies used to form the basis of this website were the coding languages HTML5 and CSS3 which were complemented by use of the Bootstrap framework.

# UX and UI

## Research

Research for the creation of this site was carried out by searching online for other freelance illustrators who have a portfolio website; links to the main sites used are linked below. These sites were examined with the end goal of extracting the key elements required for an illustrators portfolio site. From this examination, I established that information about the illustrator, examples of their work, links to their social media pages and a means of contacting them were common across all of these sites. The importance of using the illustrators images through the sites was also evident, maximising the exposure of their original works to the user.

* Illustrator #1: [Sophie Potter](https://www.sophiepotter.co.uk/)
* Illustrator #2: [Dave Bain](https://davebain.com/about)
* Illustrator #3: [Carys Tait](https://www.carys-ink.com/about)
* Illustrator #4: [Amy Jackson](https://www.ajillustration.co.uk/bio)
* Illustrator #5: [Jessica Smith](https://www.jessicasmithillustration.co.uk/)
* Illustrator #6: [Gemma Hastilow](https://gemmahastilow.co.uk/)

&nbsp;

## Owner Goals

  * Showcase illustrations and examples of previous work.
  * To generate interest in their work.
  * To receive new commissions.

&nbsp;

## User Stories

### First Time Visitor

  * As a first time user, I want to understand the main purpose of the site.
  * As a first time user, I want relevant content that informs about the owner and their work.
  * As a first time user, I want an easy means of contacting the site owner.

### Returning Visitor

  * As a returning user, I want to be easily able to locate and review images or information on the site.
  * As a returning user, I want to be able to quickly contact the site owner.
  * As a returning user, I want to be able to quickly access the site owner's social media links.

&nbsp;

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

  * Familiar and intuitive design that negates any learning curve.
  * A reactive site that is user friendly and well presented on all types of device and screen sizes.
  * An easy and logical means of navigation throughout the site on all devices.
  * Adequate levels of color contrast across the site that presents content in an accessible and easy to read manner.
  * An appealing presentation of the owner's original illustrations.
  * Links to the owner's social media sites and other material of interest.

### Expectations

  * Feedback when interacting with page links which allows me to easily know where I am on the site and where I can navigate to.
  * Feedback on the contact form to inform me when it has been completed and submitted correctly.
  * When clicking on social media links, they should open in a seperate tab or window.

&nbsp;

## Design

### Color Scheme

* Various shades of grey ( #708090, #545454, #d3d3d3, #3f3f3f) were used across the site (nav bar, footer, scroll to top button) alongside black and white for the textual content. These sombre colours were purposely chosen to give the site a clean modern look while allowing the vibrant colours of the various illustrations to pop on the screen; all while adhering to the WCAG 2.1 contrast guidelines.

### Fonts

* The Google font of Barlow was chosen as it closely resembles font used on other promotional work by the site owner. Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast font which fits in with the clean modern look of the site.
  
### Imagery

* All images used across the site, including background images, are original creations of the site owner. The background images were used on the home page (callout banner) and contact me page (form) to provide a visually appealing backdrop to these pages, helping to highlight content contained within.

### Structure

* The information architecture type used for this site is the hierarchical tree structure. This common structure allows for simple navigation throughout the site and allows for easy expansion of the site in the future. The use of the burger navigation icon, along with a floating return to top button, help to overcome the common issues with this structure on mobile devices.

# Features 

## Existing Features

* Navigation Bar

  * Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home, My Work, Gallery and Sign Up pages and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  * The user's current location is indicated by white text in the menu list items with the other items in a muted shade of grey; menu items are also highlighted when hovering over them, adding a responsive element.
  * The navigation menu will collapse into a burger icon on mobile screens allowing for a more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience.

    ![Nav Bar](/readme-files/images/nav-bar.png)

* Callout Banner

  * The callout banner serves to introduce the user to the site owner with an eye catching avatar and background image used to grab their attention.  

    ![Landing Page](/readme-files/images/callout-banner.png)

* About Me Section

  * The about me section will further introduce the user to the site owner, informing them of their skills and education background. 

    ![About Me](/readme-files/images/about-me.png)

* The Footer

  * The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for the site owner; all links open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.     * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
  * There is also copyright information contained in the footer to remind the user that the site's content is not licence free.

    ![Footer](/readme-files/images/footer.png)

* The My Work Page

  * This page will allow the user to see some examples of the work already created by the site owner by describing and showcasing a varied selection of their work.

    ![My Work](/readme-files/images/my-work.png)

* Gallery

  * The gallery will provide the user with a variety of original illustrations created by the site owner.
  * This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to clearly see the various illustration styles used by the site owner. 

    ![Gallery](/readme-files/images/gallery.png)

* Contact Me

  * The contact me page will provide a form for the user to submit a message in order to make enquiries or request a commission. 
  * The user will be asked to submit their name, email address, and a message describing their proposal. 

    ![Contact Me](/readme-files/images/contact-me.png)

* Back to Top Button

  * A floating back to top button was used to allow the user an easy means of returning to the nav bar, this is especially important for mobile devices where the content is stretched vertically.

     ![Back to Top Button](/readme-files/images/back-to-top-btn.png)

## Features to be Implemented in Future

  * Adding an isotope filter to the gallery page once I have a better understanding of JavaScript. This will allow users to more easily view illustrations that share a common theme or style.
  * Additionally, I would like to use JavaScript to better control the positioning of the back to top button; having it fade in as you scroll down the page.
  * An extra shop page that allows users to purchase items such as prints, cards and badges directly from the owner.
